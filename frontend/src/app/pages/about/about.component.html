<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Here you can find infos about the webapp, the rules and the scoring system.
</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
    The rules are simple.
    <span class="highlight">Don't break the webapp!</span> besides you should
    follow along the following guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Don't use any automated tools to solve the challenges.</li>
    <li>Don't use AI, as this challenges should refresh your know-how.</li>
    <li>Don't share the solutions to other participants.</li>
    <li>
        Every challenge related information is in the challenge page, there are
        no hidden information elsewhere (e.g. in the webapp source code)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>
    Every day there is a challenge which has two sub-challenges. For each
    correct submission per sub-challenge you will get one ‚≠ê (<a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star"
        >star</a
    >).
</p>
<p>
    By starting the challenge a timer gets started. If you manage to solve both
    sub-challenges the timer gets terminated. The person with the shortest
    solving time per day gets in addition a üßâ (<a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.eltonymate.com/"
        >mate</a
    >).
</p>
<p>
    The leaderboard gets calculated as
    <span class="highlight">sum of stars + sum of mates.</span>
</p>
<h3>About the Webapp</h3>
<p>
    The source code of the webapp can be found on
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JohnTrunix/advent-of-ds"
        >Github</a
    >. The webapp is written in JavaScript (Angular, TS), uses a FastAPI
    (Python) backend and uses a PostgreSQL database. In addition to store the
    challenges, a MongoDB is used.
</p>
<p>
    As I like to exaggerate a bit, in addition to the stack above, the webapp is
    deployed on a Kubernetes cluster and uses a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the
    changes to the cluster. The cluster is hosted privately.
